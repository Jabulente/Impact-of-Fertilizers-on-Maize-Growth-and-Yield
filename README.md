<h1 align='center'>🌽 Impact of Fertilizers on Maize Growth and Yield</h1>

## 📊 Overview

This project presents a comprehensive data-driven analysis of how different types and application rates of fertilizers influence **maize (corn) growth and yield**. Using Python-based statistical methods and visualizations, the project explores critical growth parameters and yield indicators to evaluate the effectiveness of various fertilizer treatments. It serves as a valuable resource for agronomists, researchers, agricultural students, and policymakers seeking to optimize maize productivity through informed fertilizer management.

The study involves detailed data exploration, descriptive statistics, hypothesis testing, and visual analysis to draw meaningful insights about nutrient effectiveness. It helps identify which fertilizers contribute most significantly to improved crop performance, offering practical guidance for decision-making in crop production systems.

## 🔬 Methodology

1. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

   * Handle missing values, convert units, standardize column names.

2. **Descriptive Analysis**

   * Summary statistics (mean, std, range) for growth parameters (e.g., height, leaf area, biomass) and yield (e.g., grain weight, cob length).

3. **Inferential Analysis**

   * One-way ANOVA to test for significant differences across fertilizer treatments.
   * Tukey’s HSD for pairwise group comparisons.
   * Correlation analysis between fertilizer rates and yield components.

4. **Visualization**

   * Boxplots, line plots, and bar graphs to represent treatment effects.
   * Heatmaps to show correlations among variables.

## 🧪 Variables Analyzed

* **Fertilizer Types**: Organic, Inorganic (e.g., Urea, DAP, NPK), and Combinations
* **Growth Metrics**: Plant height, stem diameter, number of leaves, biomass
* **Yield Metrics**: Grain weight, cob size, number of cobs per plant
* **Fertilizer Rates**: Application doses in kg/ha or g/plant
