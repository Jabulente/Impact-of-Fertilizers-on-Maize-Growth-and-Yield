# *Data Exploration and Hypothesis Testing*

## Overview

This repository contains a curated collection of data analysis projects focused on exploratory data analysis (EDA) and hypothesis testing. The goal is to demonstrate how to investigate data, extract meaningful patterns, and make data-driven conclusions using statistical inference. Projects include both real-world and synthetic datasets to showcase a range of analytical techniques in practical and controlled scenarios.

## Goals

* Apply EDA techniques to summarize and visualize datasets.
* Formulate and test hypotheses using appropriate statistical methods.
* Interpret and communicate findings in a clear, data-informed manner.
* Provide reusable and adaptable code for learning and research purposes.

## Key Features

* **EDA Workflows:** Handling missing data, outlier detection, and feature distributions through visualization and summary statistics.
* **Hypothesis Testing:** Implementation of statistical tests such as t-tests, ANOVA, chi-square tests, correlation tests, and non-parametric alternatives.
* **Use of Real and Synthetic Data:** Real datasets to reflect real-world complexity, and synthetic data to illustrate specific testing scenarios.
* **Well-Commented Code:** All notebooks and scripts are clearly documented for ease of understanding and reuse.
* **Result Interpretation:** Each project includes a summary of findings and interpretation of test results in the context of the data.
